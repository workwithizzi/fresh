### Snippets

The `snippets/` directory is not imported into Luscious or the project by default. It could be considered a 'pattern library' of sorts but focused on SASS code. It's also a Work In Progress. You can copy/paste from the snippets or `@import` them directly into your project and they should be set up to work with Luscious tools. Any file that doesn't start with the `@` symbol should be safe to use.

Currently Includes:
- normalize.css - version 7
- base.sass     - for html and body basic setup
- resets.sass   - for some opinionated resets on top of normalize.
