# Luscious SASS
*A Library or SASS functions/mixin/variables/stuff*

**Current Version: v0.0.3 on Master branch**
After testing, Stable version will be released as v1.0.0


**A work in progress.**
Still need to:
1. A documentation.
2. A proper README.
3. Test a few things.
4. Add a few things.
5. Make another cup of coffee.

Good luck :)
