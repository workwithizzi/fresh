### Themes

**Feel free to remove this directory for projects that don't need this level of structure**

On larger sites and applications, it is not unusual to have different themes. There are certainly different ways of dealing with themes but I personally like having theme-specific files in a `themes/` directory. http://sass-guidelin.es/#themes-folder

*Note â€” This is very project-specific and is likely to be non-existent on many projects.*
