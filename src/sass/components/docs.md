### Components
If objects are the smallest build blocks, components are the larger, more complex building blocks that you use throughout your site. Components can be built from simple objects or by combining multiple components together. If you’ve read Atomic Design, consider components to be organisms. (Except this organism can contain other organisms). https://goo.gl/m3Sr5G
Components have the following properties:
1. Components uses a `.c_` prefix.
2. Components can contain other objects and components.
3. Components are context aware—they can affect surrounding website elements.
