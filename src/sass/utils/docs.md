### Utilities

**Feel free to remove this directory for projects that don't need this level of structure**

The files in the `utils/` directory should not output any CSS on their own. This is where you can import 3rd-party vendors or add any project-specific functions, mixins, or librariesâ€”as you need them.
Be careful not to override any vendor files that could get overridden in an updated.
