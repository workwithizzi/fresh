### Objects
Objects are the smallest building blocks of a website. They should be self contained and have the ability to be added almost anywhere in your site without affecting surrounding elements. If youâ€™ve heard of Atomic Design, consider objects to be a hybrid of elements and molecules.
Objects should be unaware of their specific context, so if you are styling an object for a specific placement, you should put that object in it's related component file. For example, `.o_email-signup__btn` might go in a `components/email_signup.sass` file.

Objects have the following properties:
	1. Objects can use the `.o_` prefix for better clarity. But don't have to.
	2. Certain objects can ignore the .o_ prefix when it makes sense.
	3. They cannot contain other objects or components.
	4. They are unaware of context
